KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER

The Success Type Personality: 

SENSE OF DIRECTION
    - We're engineered as goal-seeking mechanisms. When we have no personal goals that we're interested in and that mean something to us, we're likely to "go around in circles", feel lost and like there is no purpose to life
    - Prescription:  Get a project that interest you. Decide what you want out of a situation and go towards it agressively. Always have something to look forward to, develop a nostalgia for the future

UNDERSTANDING
    - Communication is vital to any guidance system. To deal effectively with a problem, we have to undestand it
    - NO ONE REACTS TO THINGS AS THEY ARE BUT TO THEIR OWN MENTAL IMAGES. Many times we create confusion about a situation by adding our fears and judgements to it. A good practice is to give other people credit for being sincere instead of assuming they're doing things to hurt you
    - Prescription: Look and seek out true information about yourself, other people, problems and situations. An automatic guidance system needs negative feedback data to correct its course. Admit your mistakes but don't dwell on them. Correct them and move forward

COURAGE
    - Having a goal and understand the situation is not enough, we need to have the courage to act as by actions can goals become realities. All problems become smaller if we don't dodge them, but confront them. Standing still, not acting, when faced with a problem causes us to feel nervous, "trapped"
    - If we wait until we're absolutely sure before we act, we'll never do anything. You can be wrong any time you act. But your guidance mechanism can't guide you if you're standing still. Take action and correct if necessary, let the guidance system do its work
    - Prescription: Be willing to make some mistakes to get what you want. Don't sell yourself short. You have the resources to solve any problem, give them a chance to work for you. Also, practice courage on small daily things. Small success build up the feeling of success and that's where we want to be

COMPASSION
    - Our feelings about ourselves tend to correspond to our feelings about other people. One way to stop feeling guilty is to stop judging and blaming others. Feeling that other people are worthy develops a more accurate self-esteem for yourself
    - Prescription: Develop genuine appreciation for other people by realizing they're an expression of Source. Think about other people's feelings and needs when interacting with them

ESTEEM
    - HOLDING A LOW OPINION OF OURSELVES IS NOT A VIRTUE, BUT A VICE
    - Prescription: Stop carrying a mental picture of yourself as a defeated, worthless person, as an object of pity. Start to appreciate other people more, show respect for other humans as they are an expression of Source and so are you. Practice treating people as they have value, surprisingly enough your self-esteem will go up

SELF-CONFIDENCE
    - Confidence is built upon an experience of success. Small successes can be used as a stepping-stone to greater ones. Everyone has succeeded sometime at something. Specially when we start something new, call up past successes in some past experience, no matter how small
    - Prescription: It's important to develop the habit of remembering past successes and forgetting failures. It doesn't matter how many times you failed in the past, what matters are the succesful attempts, that should be remembered and dwelt upon. We can also relive our brave moments as well as successes, to be in the feeling of courage

SELF-ACCEPTANCE
    - No real success is possible until a person gains some degree of self-acceptance. Success comes from self-expression and often eludes those who strive to "be somebody" instead of being themselves
    - Changing our self-image doesn't mean changing our self but changing our own "mental picture" of that self
    - We can change our personality, not our basic self. Personality is a tool, a focal point of the "self" that we use when dealing with the world. It's the sum of our habits, attitudes, skills and it's a method of expressing ourselves
    - The negative aspects of our personality belong to us, THEY ARE NOT US. You may have made a mistake but that doesn't mean you are a mistake
    - It's important to accept the fact that our personality is always imperfect, it's always moving toward an ideal goal and never arriving. It's important to accept this personality with all its imperfections cause it's the only vehicle we have
    - Prescription: Accept yourself as you are, where you are. Learn to tolerate imperfection in yourself. It's necessary to intellectually recognize our shortcomings but disastrous to hate ourselves for them

"Accept yourself. Be yourself. You cannot realize the potentialities and possibilities inherent in that unique and special something that is YOU if you keep turning your back on it, feeling ashamed of it, hating it, or refusing to recognize it."



YOUR CASE HISTORY
List here an experience from your past that is explained by the principles given in this chapter:

The Courage section brings something to mind. A while back I started feeling anxious about my relationship with Gia, us having to hide being a couple at Ramos was truly upsetting me and I felt rejected. What I did was stall, ignore it and hope it went again. And it got bigger, and bigger, and bigger. I lashed out to her and it did cause a lot of distance between us. 
So I can see how letting things fester is not worth it. It was something that could have been solved with a couple of conversations and it got blown way out of proportion. I learnt a big lesson from this and I intend to be open, forward and honest with my loved ones when a situation like this arises. I learnt from this and that makes it a valuable experience, it's a way of course correcting that is already helping me achieve the goals I have going forward. And for that, I'm grateful
