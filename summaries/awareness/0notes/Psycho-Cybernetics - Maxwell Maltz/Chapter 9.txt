KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER

There are signals of the failure type mentality. They're like check lights that come on to tell us something is wrong and that needs correcting, negative feedback. We usually develop these behaviors cause we think they'll help us achieve our goals but they do not. They keep us away from the things we want

FRUSTRATION
    - Chronic frustration usually means we've set unrealistic goals for ourselves or that we have an inadequate image of ourselves    
    - Expressing frustration as a way to solve problems is something we learn as children. We cry, our parents solve our problem. But this does not apply in adulthood
    - Constantly feeling frustrated makes us accostumed to defeat. This then becomes habitual to us and we continue to experience inadequate

AGRESSIVENESS
    - Being agressive is not the problem, agressiveness helps us in the achievement of our goal. The problem comes when we are frustrated in achieving our goal. Then when direct the agressive energy not towards accomplishing our goal, but on self-destructive manners
    - When we feel like snapping at someone, let's stop and ask ourselves "Am I just frustrated? What is frustrating me?". Having awareness of it alows us to redirect the energy in a productive way
    - Physical exercise is a great way of letting off agression. But the best way to channel it is with work towards our objective

INSECURITY
    - We feel insecure not for a lack of personal habilities, but because we are judging ourselves too harshly. We compare our ideals with an absolute, a perfect ideal that is not achievable
    - We are always in the process of becoming, always moving. We keep our balance in movement. If we think we've already achieved our goal, we stand still and we lose the security we felt when we were moving towards our objective
    - If you're already perfect, there is no need to fight, to try. And if you do try, it means you're not perfect so you don't try. And here is where you lose the will to win

LONELINESS
    - Chronic loneliness is caused by an alienation from life. Someone feels lonely, so they avoid other people which keeps them from the contact that would help them overcoming this, interaction with others. Enjoying things with other people helps us forget ourselves
    - It's a form of self-protection, to protect the idealized self from hurt or humilliation
    - A passive attitude, that is up to other people to come to them. Never thinking that they should contribute something to the social situation 

UNCERTAINTY
    - Avoiding making mistakes and responsability. If no decision is made, I can't be wrong. And not being wrong is vital if we think of ourselves as perfect
    - You can't move forward without mistakes, you can't correct course if you're standing still. Look at your options, analyze them and try the one that seems best. You can always correct along the way
    - Making mistakes and owning up to them is a sign of strength

RESENTMENT 
    - Resenting the success and happiness of others cause it's proof of personal failure. It's giving an explanation to the failure as a great injustice. This becomes a habit and makes it impossible for us to be happy
    - It's also a way of making ourselves feel important. The victim of an injustice is morally superior to the ones who commited it
    - Resentment is a mental resistance (non-acceptance) of something that already happened
    - Habitually feeling a victim of injustice ends with you picturing yourself as a victim, which is the experience you continue to have. As long as you feel resentment, you can't see yourself asn a self-reliant, independant person 
    - Being resentful is giving your power away to other people, you expect something from them and if it doesn't happen, you resent them for it. It's passive, which contradicts the goal-striving mechanism: you set your goals and go after them

EMPTINESS
    - You can achieve the symbols of success and still feel empty, not being able to enjoy them
    - Life becomes worthwhile when you have worthwhile goals. You may not have a goal that motivates you, or your not using your skills to go after a meaningful goal. That leads to the conclusion that life has no purpose
    - Emptiness can become an excuse for avoiding effort, work and responsability. Why bother? Why try?
    - Striving for real success on the things that are important to you bring a deep satisfaction

All these characteristics are signals that can help us steer ourselves towards the positive. They're alerting us that something is not working. We recognize they're signals that are not desirable, that are not getting us closer towards our goal. Then we take immediate action towards a positive factor from the Success Mechanism 


YOUR CASE HISTORY 
List here an experience from your past that is explained by the principles given in this chapter:

This came just in the right time cause it comes to mind what I've been experiencing regarding my career. I felt frustrated that I wasn't advancing, cause I was setting goals that are way too high, demanding perfect design from me. Since I couldn't do that in one try, I didn't try at all. Also, building a network of contacts means talking to people and I didn't want to do that, isolating myself from others and then feeling inferior cause when I need to test out content and design I have no one to talk to. And that's cause I isolate myself and refuse to interact with others.

It's crystal clear that all of these behaviors are not getting me to where I want to go. So now that I see this, I can correct course. I can make it a point to interact with others. For example, Coderhouse slack. I can easily go in daily, answer to a couple of card sortings and help people out. It'll be a couple of minutes of my day and it'd be building out relationships that can help me when I need to test something out. Build out a network that can help me be a better designer, consider others and build solutions that help them

Really, I feel a little shocked that I relate to all the parts of this. All of them, I relate with all of them. It's a good thing I'm seeing it likes this, it's showing me in a clear way what's going on. Cause I have been feeling it's pointless, why try? If it can't be excelent then why do it at all? And this perfectionism is just standing in my way. It's a way of avoiding action, making excuses, feeling like a victim. And I don't want this anymore. I intend to be a professional web developer, I intend to build digital products that help people achieve their goals and that solve problems. I'm committed to my success so we're done feeling sorry for ourselves, and making excuses. I intend to actively pursue my projects, to take action and to continuously move forward
