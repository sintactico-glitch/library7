                    <h2>Chapter 1: Why Lean UX?</h2>
                    <p>The different departments of a company (Marketing, Operations, IT, Design, etc) all work with agility but the companies remain rigid and slow. The interactions between departments is still based on an outdated industrial past. <strong>We're building linear organizations in a world that demands constant change.</strong></p>
                    <p>Designers approached software in the same way the approached the earlier materials they worked with. When designing for physical materials you have to figure out what you're making before starting production because production is expensive.</p>
                    <p>Now most software is distributed online. We are no longer limited by a physical manufacturing process and we can work in much shorter release cycles. Teams are now also facing intense competition from other companies that are using these <strong>short cycles as a competitive advantage</strong> (release early and often, gain market feedback and iterate based on what you learn).</p>
                    <blockquote class="highlight">Traditional "get it all figured out first" approaches are no longer workable. You need to know (as a team) that you're not going to get it right the first time and that you're all working together to <strong>iterate your way forward</strong>.</blockquote>

                    <h3>The 3 Foundations of Lean UX</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Design Thinking</h4>
                            <p>"Innovation powered by <strong>direct observation of what people want and need</strong> in their lives and what they like or dislike about the way particular products are made, packaged, marketed, sold and supported"</p>
                            <p>Every aspect of a business can be approached with design methods.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Agile Software Development</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. To generate the best solutions quickly, you must <strong>engage the entire team, ideas must be exchanged freely and frequently</strong>.</li>
                                <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation. By building software sooner, solutions can be assesed for market fit and viability.</li>
                                <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Collaborating with your teammates and customers builds a <strong>shared understanding of the problem space and proposed solutions</strong>. It also lessens dependancy on heavy documentation since the whole team participated in the decisions.</li>
                                <li>Responding to change over following a plan. <strong>The initial product designs will be wrong</strong>, so the goal should be to <strong>find out what's wrong with them as soon as possible</strong>. Once we discover what's working and what's not, <strong>we adjust our proposals and test again</strong>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Lean Startup Method</h4>
                            <p>Create <strong>rapid prototypes designed to test the proposed solution with customer feedback</strong>. The smallest thing you can build is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), which doesn't have to be code</p>
                            <p>You collect what you learn from your MVP and then evolve your ideas. <strong>Then you do it again.</strong></p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
