                <h2>Chapter 1: Why Lean UX?</h2>
                <p>The different departments of a company (Marketing, Operations, IT, Design, etc) all work with agility but the companies remain rigid and slow. The interactions between departments is still based on an outdated industrial past. We're building linear organizations in a world that demands constant change.</p>
                <p>Designers approached software in the say way the approached the earlier materials they worked with. When designing for physical materials you have to figure out what you're making before starting production because production is expensive.</p>
                <p>Now most software is distributed online. We are no longer limited by a physical manufacturing process and we can work in much shorter release titles. Teams are now also facing intense competition from competitors that are using these short cycles as a competitive advantage (release early and often, gain market feedback and iterate base on what they learn).</p>
                <p class="highlight">Traditional "get it all figured out first" approaches are no longer workable. You need to know (as a team) that you're not going to get it right the first time and that you're all working together to <strong>iterate your way forward</strong>.</p>
