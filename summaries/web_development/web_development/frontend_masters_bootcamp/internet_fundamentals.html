                    <p>The client:</p>
                    <p>Is the device in front of you, it runs a web browser (software that runs on the client that displays webpages like Chrome, Firefox, etc)</p>
                    <p>The server:</p>
                    <p>It's where your public website is going to live</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hardware server: the physical computer that serves up web pages</li>
                        <li>Software server: program that executes the commands to send files out so the website can be seen (Apache)</li>

                    <h3>Client-Server Communications</h3>
                    <p>If I'm looking for a certain webpage from my client, I'm looking for an specific server to give me that particular information.</p>
                    <p>Instead of comparing the internet to a series of tubes, we can compare it to an envelope delivered by the post office. The address on the envelope could be the Google home page and the return address would be the address of my computer.</p>
                    <p>The addresses are IP addresses (www.site24x7.com/find-ip-address-of-web-site.html, www.whatismyip.com)</p>
                    <p>The domain name of a site is much more memorable to humans. We can type that into the browser and the computer will match the domain name with the IP address.</p>
                    <p>ISP: Internet Service Provider. Also needed to provide internet access.</p>
                    <p>The ISP is going to provid the IP address to the modem or router in your house. Inside your house you may have a lot of devices running. The router will control more IP addresses within your house. To the outside world, all of your home traffic looks the same. The router sends the specific requests to the devices that made them.</p>
                    <p>The cloud = just another name for the internet</p>
                    <p>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol</p>
                    <p>It's the way we're communicating the clients and servers. HTPPS indicates that it's secure. For example, in ecommerce, HTTPS encrypts the transmission from the computer you're using to the computer where you're running the transaction. It only secures the transmission, the computer that's receiving the info has to have additional security using different ways. </p>
                    <p>Another protocol is FTP, the File Transfer Protocol. A protocol designed to send a file from one computer to another</p>
