                    <p>The client:</p>
                    <p>Is the device in front of you, it runs a web browser (software that runs on the client that displays webpages like Chrome, Firefox, etc)</p>
                    <p>The server:</p>
                    <p>It's where your public website is going to live</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hardware server: the physical computer that serves up web pages</li>
                        <li>Software server: program that executes the commands to send files out so the website can be seen (Apache)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="article__img">

                <article id="article2">
                    <h3>Client-Server Communications</h3>
                    <p>If I'm looking for a certain webpage from my client, I'm looking for an specific server to give me that particular information.</p>
                    <p>Instead of comparing the internet to a series of tubes, we can compare it to an envelope delivered by the post office. The address on the envelope could be the Google home page and the return address would be the address of my computer.</p>
                    <p>The addresses are IP addresses (www.site24x7.com/find-ip-address-of-web-site.html, www.whatismyip.com)</p>
                    <p>The domain name of a site is much more memorable to humans. We can type that into the browser and the computer will match the domain name with the IP address.</p>
                    <p>ISP: Internet Service Provider. Also needed to provide internet access.</p>
                    <p>The ISP is going to provid the IP address to the modem or router in your house. Inside your house you may have a lot of devices running. The router will control more IP addresses within your house. To the outside world, all of your home traffic looks the same. The router sends the specific requests to the devices that made them.</p>
                    <p>The cloud = just another name for the internet</p>
                    <p>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol</p>
                    <p>It's the way we're communicating the clients and servers. HTPPS indicates that it's secure. For example, in ecommerce, HTTPS encrypts the transmission from the computer you're using to the computer where you're running the transaction. It only secures the transmission, the computer that's receiving the info has to have additional security using different ways. </p>
                    <p>Another protocol is FTP, the File Transfer Protocol. A protocol designed to send a file from one computer to another</p>

                    <h3>Understanding Web Hosting</h3>
                    <p>Websites live on servers. But you don't have a server in your house! </p>
                    <p>You could have your website up on your computer, but then you'd have people from all over the world getting into your computer to see your website, which is not recommended. It's much better to rent space on a server through web hosting.</p>
                    <p>A good webhost: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Updates the server and keeps it secure</li>
                        <li>Provides high uptime</li>
                        <li>Provides reasonable bandwidth (data transfer). Every file uploaded uses an amount of data, like the data on your phone plan. It's important to make sure that you have enough data to suppor the traffic you're site is getting</li>
                        <li>Provides technical support as needed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Create web files, organized in folders, on your computer. Transfer the files and any folders to the web host (FileZilla is a good option). The web host tells you how to connect with FTP</p>
                    <p>Domain name: It's what we type in the computer to get to our website. Lots of endings for websites, the most common is .com. The host provides a temporary address that's not very memorable</p>
